📚 Ethical Frameworks

 1. 🎯 Utilitarianism

Core Principle: Actions are right if they maximize overall happiness and minimize suffering.

Key Features:
- Consequence-based evaluation
- Calculates utility: `(magnitude × probability × people_affected)`
- Impartial consideration of all stakeholders

Example: In the trolley problem, pull the lever to save 5 lives at the cost of 1 (net: +4 lives).

2. ⚖️ Deontology

Core Principle: Follow moral duties and rules, regardless of consequences.

Key Features:
- Duty-based evaluation
- Categorical imperative: "Treat people as ends, never merely as means"
- Respects individual autonomy and rights

Example: Don't pull the lever because actively killing is always wrong, even to save more lives.

3. 💎 Virtue Ethics
Core Principle: Act according to virtuous character traits.

Key Features:
- Character-based evaluation
- Cultivates virtues: courage, compassion, honesty, justice, wisdom
- Applies practical wisdom (phronesis)
*Example: A courageous and compassionate person would pull the lever, taking responsibility for a difficult decision.

4. ❤️ Care Ethics

Core Principle: Maintain relationships and respond to needs.

Key Features:
- Relationship-based evaluation
- Contextual decision-making
- Prioritizes care for vulnerable individuals

Example: Consider specific relationships and responsibilities before deciding.

🎭 Example Dilemmas

1. The Trolley Problem

> A runaway trolley is heading toward five people. You can pull a lever to divert it to another track where one person is tied. What do you do?

Possible Actions: `pull_lever`, `do_nothing`

Framework Recommendations:
- Utilitarianism: Pull lever (Score: 40)
- Deontology: Do nothing (Score: 30)
- Virtue Ethics: Pull lever with courage (Score: 50)
- Care Ethics: Context-dependent (Score: 35)

2. Biased AI Hiring System

> Your company's AI tool is efficient but discriminates against female candidates. Do you deploy it?

Possible Actions: `deploy_system`, `fix_bias_first`, `abandon_ai`, `deploy_with_disclosure`

Framework Recommendations:
- Utilitarianism: Fix bias first (Score: 45)
- Deontology: Fix bias first (Score: 90)
- Virtue Ethics: Fix bias first (Score: 90)
- Care Ethics: Fix bias first (Score: 80)

3. Corporate Whistleblower

> You discover illegal toxic waste dumping. Reporting will save the environment but cause job losses. What do you do?

**Possible Actions**: `report_to_authorities`, `report_internally`, `stay_silent`, `anonymous_tip`

Framework Recommendations:
- Utilitarianism: Report to authorities (Score: 82)
- Deontology: Report to authorities (Score: 70)
- Virtue Ethics: Report with courage (Score: 85)
- Care Ethics: Report internally first (Score: 65)


Other Dilemmas

4. Autonomous Vehicle Dilemma- Who should self-driving cars save?
5. Medical Triage - Who receives the last ventilator?
6. Lying to Protect - Is it ethical to lie to save someone?
7. Climate vs Economy - Aggressive climate action vs gradual transition?

ETHICAL ANALYSIS
=================================================
Dilemma: The Trolley Problem
Framework: utilitarianism

RECOMMENDED ACTION: pull_lever
Ethical Score: 40.0

--- REASONING TRACE ---
Step 1: Identify ethical framework principles
  - maximize_happiness: Actions are right if they maximize overall happiness
  - minimize_suffering: Reduce suffering for the greatest number

Step 2: Analyze action properties
  - respects_autonomy: false
  - uses_as_means: true

Step 3: Evaluate consequences and impacts
  - save_five_lives (probability: 1.0)
  - kill_one_person (probability: 1.0)

--- DETAILED EXPLANATION ---
From a utilitarian perspective, this action maximizes overall welfare...

3. **Debate**: Discuss whether the system's reasoning is sound
4. **Extend**: Implement new ethical theories (e.g., Confucian ethics)

⚠️ Limitations & Disclaimers

   Important Notes

- 📌 **Not a Substitute for Human Judgment**: This is an educational tool, not a decision-making authority
- 📌 **Simplified Models**: Real ethical reasoning is more nuanced
- 📌 **Western Philosophy Focus**: Current frameworks reflect Western ethical traditions
- 📌 **Incomplete Information**: Real dilemmas often lack clear probabilities
- 📌 **No Meta-Ethics**: The system doesn't evaluate frameworks themselves

Ethical Considerations

This system demonstrates how machines can reason about ethics, but:

- Moral decisions require empathy, wisdom, and context
- Different cultures may have different ethical frameworks
- Quantifying ethics has inherent limitations
- Always consult ethics experts for real-world decisions
